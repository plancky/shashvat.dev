Hello there! I used to be an aspiring Physicist but now I
develop software for a living(and for fun!). I
write about things that capture my attention or things
others might find interesting. Take some time out to check out my posts,
other works or contact me at <span class=" hyphens-none">shashvat817@gmail.com</span>.
