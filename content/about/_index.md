Hi! I am Shashvat Jain, and I enjoy tinkering with mathematics, computer software.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Physics and I am currently a software developer at [487 studios](https://www.foureightseven.studio/), where I am mostly involved in web-realted engineering.

I truly believe that people should be identified by the work they put out and the lessons they learn and share. Even when I write this, or anything related to me, I feel a pull towards artificial sophistry and unnecessary beautification which make it difficult to share the real me and experiences. I believe this is because of an unconscious struggle in human minds to avoid embarrassment, the kind you feel when you make a dumb mistake. I will try my best to go against this pull and share experiences as they are. By saying the above I connect with what Andrew says [here](https://boz.com/about).
