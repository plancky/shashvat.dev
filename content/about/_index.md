Hi! My name is Shashvat Jain, and I find joy in playing around with computer software.

I am a software engineer at [487 studios](https://www.foureightseven.studio/), where I am mostly involved in web development related work. I also hold a bachelor's degree in Physics, contributing to my broad range of analytical and problem-solving skills.

As of early 2025, I have started to read about western history, and I have been having fun playing basketball on the regular. From the top of my mind some of my major interests are, but not limited to, table tennis, bouldering, computer graphics, game dev, and Artifical Intelligence.

I aim to use this site as a platform to share myself and the cool things I learn, technical or otherwise. I truly believe that people should be identified by the work they put out, and the lessons they learn and share. As I write this, or anything related to me, I feel a pull towards artificial sophistry which makes it difficult to share actual experiences. I believe this is because of an unconscious struggle in our minds to avoid embarrassment, the kind you feel when you make a dumb mistake. By saying the above I connect with what Andrew says [here](https://boz.com/about). I will try my best to share experiences as they are.
