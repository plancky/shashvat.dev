Hi! I am Shashvat Jain, and I enjoy tinkering with computer software.

I hold a bachelor's degree in Physics and I am currently a software developer at [487 studios](https://www.foureightseven.studio/), where I am mostly involved in web-related engineering.

I aim to use this site as a platform to share myself and the cool things I learn, technical or otherwise. I truly believe that people should be identified by the work they put out, and the lessons they learn and share. As I write this, or anything related to me, I feel a pull towards artificial sophistry which makes it difficult to share actual experiences. I believe this is because of an unconscious struggle in our minds to avoid embarrassment, the kind you feel when you make a dumb mistake. By saying the above I connect with what Andrew says [here](https://boz.com/about). I will try my best to share experiences as they are.
